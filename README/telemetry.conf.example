# This file contains possible attributes and values for configuring global
# telemetry settings. Please note that enabling these settings would enable
# apps to collect telemetry data about app usage and other properties.
#
# There is no global, default telemetry.conf. Instead, a telemetry.conf may
# exist in each app in Splunk Enterprise.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see
# the documentation located at
